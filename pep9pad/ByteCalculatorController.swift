import UIKit

class ByteCalculatorController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
    
    //  Create the byte converter by subclassing the UIAlertController class.  It should have five UITextField objects, corresponding to decimal, hex, binary, ASCII, and Asm.  Add in some UILabel objects somewhere (perhaps in the textfields) to clue the user in on which is which.  Each text field should only accept input that makes sense; i.e. decimal field should accept numbers only, 0-255.  A change in one text field should populate the other textFields accordingly.  Check Pep9 repo for the byteconverter___.cpp files, these should have some useful regexps.
